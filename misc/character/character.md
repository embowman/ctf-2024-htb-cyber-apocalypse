## Character

This was the first challenge I attempted. This was also the first time I had used the socket library.
I was under the impression that the spawned docker container may have a time limit, and to ensure that I
earned at least one flag, I did a shoddy job of working around the hanging sendall method by just creating
a new connection for each character ðŸ˜‚ I've improved! I promise haha
